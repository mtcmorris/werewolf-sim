# A Quick Werewolf simulation....

## What

A simulation of playing a fairly rational game of werewolf where the villagers simply lynch randomly.  When someone is proposed to be lynched they can reveal their role to avoid lynching but by rational werewolfs should be eaten the next evening.

Other variable is at what point the seer should reveal themselves.  A ~59% win rate can be achieved consistently by the seer revealling themselves on a bunch of fairly basic conditions.
